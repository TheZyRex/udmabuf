	help
	  Enable this to allow the u-dma-buf to be built.
	  u-dma-buf is a linux device driver that allocates contiguous
	  memory blocks in the kernel space as DMA buffers and
	  makes them available from the user space.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

	bool "u-dma-buf enable in-kernel functions"
	depends on U_DMA_BUF
	default y
	help
	  Enable u-dma-buf in-kernel functions.
	  Setting this to y will EXPORT_SYMBOL the function to
	  manage u-dma-buf from inside the kernel.
